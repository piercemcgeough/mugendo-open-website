                <h4>COACHES</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a very large event and many competitors looking to get fighting, have a good time and get home at a reasonable time.
                    If you are bringing any number of competitors please bring enough coachs to accommodate for this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please make sure your competitors are entered their correct divisions based on experience.
                    If officials deem your competitor to be too advanced for novice or intermediate they may be
                    disqualified.
                </p>
